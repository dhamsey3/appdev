# Single application cluster in a kubernetes set up

Create a Kubernetes cluster:

You can use a cloud provider like Google Cloud, AWS or Azure to create a Kubernetes cluster or use a tool like Minikube for a local development setup.
Create a Docker image of your application:

You will need to create a Docker image of your application, which includes all the necessary dependencies and configurations.
Push the Docker image to a container registry:

You need to push your Docker image to a container registry like Docker Hub or Google Container Registry.
Write a Kubernetes deployment YAML file:

You need to create a YAML file that describes how to deploy your application on Kubernetes. This file should include the details of the container image, port mappings, environment variables, and other necessary configuration.
Create a Kubernetes deployment:

Run the kubectl create -f <deployment-file.yaml> command to create a Kubernetes deployment using the YAML file you created in step 4.
Expose the Kubernetes deployment as a service:

Run the kubectl expose deployment <deployment-name> --port=<container-port> --target-port=<container-port> --type=LoadBalancer command to expose your Kubernetes deployment as a service. This will create a load balancer that maps to the container port specified in the YAML file.
Verify the deployment:

Use the kubectl get pods command to verify that your application is running in a pod. Use the kubectl get services command to verify that the service is created and has an external IP address assigned.
Access your application:

Visit the external IP address assigned to your service in a web browser to access your application.
These are the general steps to deploy a single application cluster in a Kubernetes setup. However, the exact commands and configurations may vary depending on your specific application and Kubernetes setup.
